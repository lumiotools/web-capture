Managing inventory, staying in touch with suppliers, vetting new shipping carriers, ordering packaging supplies, and fielding customer concerns—all of these tasks have the potential to consume too much time and money. That’s why technology is so essential. With the right tools, your business will operate more efficiently, avoid shipping slow-downs, and keep your customers happy. If you’re looking for ways to make your logistics more efficient, a shipping API is a vital part of your ecommerce tech stack. But what exactly is a shipping API, and what can it do for your business?  What is a shipping API?A shipping API is a software interface that connects ecommerce platforms with shipping carriers to automate tasks like label generation, tracking, and rate calculations. The API works as a bridge between your website and a carrier’s platform, allowing data to travel between them.  While carriers like USPSopen_in_new, UPSopen_in_new, and FedExopen_in_new often have their own APIs, many technology providers—including EasyPost—offer multi-carrier shipping APIs that allow merchants to connect with dozens of carriers using a single integration (more on that later).Why do I need a shipping API?Customers have high expectations when it comes to online shopping. They want their products to be delivered quickly (often within just a few days) without paying a premium for shipping. By automating manual shipping processes, businesses can better meet these high consumer expectations, providing faster delivery times and lower costs. That’s the big-picture view of why your business needs a shipping API, but we can get more specific. You might need a shipping API for ecommerce if you want to automate the following tasks and capabilities: Shipping label creationOne of the most important functions of a shipping API is automatic shipping label generation, which allows businesses to quickly produce accurate, carrier-compliant labels when customers place online orders. Without the need for manual input, the chances of human error are reduced and order fulfillment can be completed more quickly.Multi-carrier supportYou’re likely familiar with the difficulties of choosing which shipping carrier(s) to partner with. Because carrier prices vary based on package size and weight, destination, delivery time, and other factors, it can be hard to know which will give you the best deal for each package you ship. Multi-carrier shipping APIs solve this problem! They integrate with multiple carriers, giving you access to a range of delivery options. This allows you to automatically choose the best carrier for each order, optimizing for cost, speed, and reliability. In addition to the money you’ll save by optimizing your shipping, multi-carrier APIs offer significant rate discounts. For example, businesses that use EasyPost save up to 83% when shipping with carriers like USPS, UPS, FedEx, DHL, and more.Address verificationAn address verification feature checks and corrects customer addresses, ensuring that orders are sent to valid, accurate destinations. This reduces delivery errors, failed shipments, and additional costs from returned packages. Real-time trackingFor today’s customers, package tracking isn’t a nice-to-have feature; it’s a requirement. A shipping API provides access to real-time tracking, allowing businesses and customers alike to follow a package’s journey from dispatch to delivery. By keeping customers informed about their package’s status, you’ll build trust and be able to resolve shipping issues more quickly.Rate and transit time calculationA shipping API can automatically calculate shipping rates and estimated transit times based on factors like package dimensions, weight, and destination. This lets online merchants offer accurate pricing to customers and helps customers make informed choices about shipping options.InsuranceIf you’re considering offering shipping insurance, a shipping API will make the process simple. Through the API, you can automatically select insurance coverage at the time of shipping, customizing it based on factors like package value or destination. The power of integration: How shipping APIs workBefore diving into how shipping APIs work, let’s take a quick step back. What exactly is an API? Simply put, an API (application programming interface) allows two software systems to communicate with each other. It follows rules that let one application make requests to another application to perform actions like creating, reading, updating, or deleting data. A shipping API allows your ecommerce platform to communicate with shipping carrier software to calculate rates and transit times, create labels, track packages, and more. For example, consider the process of creating shipping labels. Without an API, creating labels might require you to collect customer order details, go to a carrier’s website, upload all the data, and choose your preferred shipping methods. If you instead rely on an API, that order data can be used to automatically generate shipping labels for the carrier and service of your choice. No manual work necessary! The best shipping APIs work hand-in-hand with your warehouse management system (WMS) and order management system (OMS) to make the order fulfillment process smooth from start to finish. The benefits of using a shipping API for ecommerceIf you’ve read this far, you understand just how powerful a shipping API can be for an ecommerce business. This section will give a quick recap of the most important benefits. Streamlined processes. By reducing manual labor, a shipping API minimizes errors (such as incorrect addresses) and helps you get shipments out on the road faster.Cost savings. By providing real-time rate comparisons and bulk shipping discounts, a shipping API lowers costs. For example, Sticker Mule was able to save over $6,000 per month using EasyPost’s SmartRate API.Scalability. As your business grows, your shipping API should easily adapt to handle larger volumes, accommodating additional carriers, locations, and order volumes without requiring significant new infrastructure or personnel.Making integration easy: How to get startedGetting started with a shipping API is simple! Just research and select an API, work with the provider’s team to complete integration, and continue to optimize. Step 1: Pick your APISome businesses choose to integrate with carriers individually, which can create major headaches for their development teams. We recommend going with a multi-carrier shipping API, which lets you connect with national, regional, and local carriers using a single integration. As you research and evaluate different solutions, consider the following factors: Speed. Look for a solution that offers fast response times, especially during high-traffic periods.Customization. A flexible API can adapt as your business grows, making it easier to meet changing customer demands.Compatibility. Make sure the API will work well with the other systems in your logistics tech stack, including your ecommerce platform, WMS, and OMS.Cost. It’s important to understand both upfront fees and any usage-based charges before getting started with a shipping API. Customer support. When technical difficulties occasionally arise, you’ll benefit from using an API with accessible, responsive customer support.Reliability. A reliable API performs consistently, without unexpected downtime or errors. Businesses should look for established API providers with high uptime to avoid disruptions. Security. Choose a solution with robust encryption and data protection protocols to safeguard against breaches.Step 2: IntegrateAfter you choose an API, it’s time to complete your ecommerce shipping integration. During this stage, your in-house development team will use the API provider’s documentation (see an example hereopen_in_new) to connect your business's ecommerce platform or warehouse management system with the API. They’ll configure it to pull order details and automatically choose from various shipping carriers based on a customer’s location, delivery speed, and cost preferences. Generally, the API provider can provide support via phone or email communication.Step 3: Test, optimize, and succeedBefore going live, your team will conduct some tests to make sure the API accurately generates shipping labels, calculates rates, and updates tracking information. Once everything works smoothly, the integration will go live! From then on, the API will simply run in the background, streamlining multi-carrier shipping options and making your life easier.Frequently asked questions include …How long does it take to integrate a shipping API? Integrating with a new technology provider can take anywhere from a few days to several months, depending on the complexity of your operations. Fortunately, once you’ve completed the integration process with a mutli-carrier API, adding new carriers is fast and easy.How do I know if my integration is successful? You can know if your integration is successful by monitoring your shipping time, shipping costs, and order fulfillment accuracy. The future of ecommerce shippingEcommerce shipping is complicated, and high customer expectations only add to the challenges. As your business grows, you need a reliable solution to speed up shipping, reduce errors, and keep costs low.

They originally set out to build an online store and experienced first-hand the complexities of shipping. That’s when they shifted gears and started Shippo, to help merchants scale their business through shipping and help create a world-class shipping experience for all customers.What we doWe’re building the shipping platform for 21st-century e-commerce. Shippo was designed to give every merchant access to the best-in-class tools and technology reserved for retail giants until now. We’re here to show businesses they don’t have to be the size of Amazon to have a platform that can help them ship like one. Through Shippo, e-commerce businesses, marketplaces, platforms, and a variety of logistics infrastructure providers can connect to shipping carriers around the world from one API and dashboard. Today, with more than 100K e-commerce merchants and partnerships with an extensive network of carriers across the globe, we are building an ecosystem of strategic tech partners using “Shippo For Platforms” as their native shipping solutions through e-commerce platforms, c2c marketplaces, and logistics infrastructure providers.A winning track recordOur multi-carrier shipping software is well-equipped to support you as your needs grow.100KBrands that trust Shippo90%Potential savings on shipping labels$5.2BAnnual gross merchandise volume77%Average YoY growth for Shippo brands100M+Shipments annuallyGet startedOur “Shippos Everywhere”\nremote-first philosophyOur “Shippos Everywhere”\nremote-first philosophyWe are building the shipping platform for 21st-century e-commerce and doing it as a globally distributed, remote-first workforce.We believe in Shippos Everywhere–meaning teams can be successful regardless of location. At Shippo, we expect our employees–lovingly titled Shippos–to be a proactive and thoughtful bunch while also being deliberate with their time. We value empathy, compassion, and curiosity, and look for individuals who ask questions and feel comfortable leading the charge–no matter what seat they sit in–we trust our team members to get their work done. At large, we follow our values in how we work.See open roles2024 Offsite ApproachWe aim to make team offsites as seamless as possible. Leaders work with teams to pick from a variety of North America-based locations and determine when and where to work best for their teams to gather. The People Team helps leaders plan the agenda, all logistics are handled by our partners, teams receive dedicated meeting rooms, but also get to check out what other teams are doing, attend group dinners, and meet other Shippos. All offsite locations align with the following criteria:Less than 1 hour from a major airportOffsites are only 3 nights and 2 days, Tuesday - ThursdayA wide range of team-building activities are availableConsistent budgets across locationsOffsites typically take place the 3rd week of a given month, excluding our “Annual All Company Get Together,” and Holiday ShutdownSome of our benefitsWFH\nstipendsSince we are a fully remote company, we offer up to a one-time, $500 home office set-up and monthly $100 stipend to cover phone and internet.Flexibletime offExempt employees may take time off as needed, without accruing paid time off (PTO) under a traditional plan.CompanyholidaysWe offer 17 company holidays per year, including a “Holiday Shutdown” the week of December 25th.Parental\nleave We offer up to 12 weeks of paid parental leave for all birthing and non-birthing parents.Volunteer time off (VTO)Employees receive 3 days each year to volunteer with a non-profit or at a philanthropic event of their choice.401(k)\ncoverageWe cover the costs of the employee contribution 401(k) plan through Fidelity.Referral\nbonusWe reward up to $2,000 if your referred candidate is hired for a full-time position.Our values-based cultureOur values are a core part of how we operate, collaborate, and make decisions as “Shippos.” In addition to these values, we believe in giving feedback openly and treating coworkers with empathy and compassion. We look for people to join us who are curious and ask questions, feel empowered to “lead the charge,” and “act like owners” to drive our business forward, no matter what seat they are in.Path to greenWe have agency and create our own paths to green. When we get stuck we come up with solutions and build a path. We make the impossible possible. The color green is our Shippo color and represents a growth mindset, our ability to move forward and find solutions.Drivers not packagesWe are the drivers behind the success of the company. Everyone here is actively pushing the company forward every day with their actions. We love packages but we don’t want to be one. We are not passively along for the ride but we are all owners of Shippo’s success.Haven’t won yetShipping in incredibly complex. We are just at the beginning of what we want to achieve. We wake up every day thinking about how we can change the trajectory of this company. We are here to win. We bring that level of intensity to work every day.Ship to learnWe take an iterative approach to delivering value. Speed matters and we ship to learn. We have a growth mindset. We learn from our mistakes and failures to make us better. We take chances, try new things and learn from them.Our customers winIf our customers ship more, we ship more. We put delivering customer value first in everything we do.Compassionate CandorWe communicate from a position of care and our pursuit of a common goal. Candor and compassion go hand in hand in making us better as one Shippo team.Meet our leadersOur experienced and compassionate leadership team brings a variety of expertise across tech, shipping, e-commerce, and logistics, and are alumni of DoorDash, Uber, Postmates, Checkr, Amazon, Pinterest, and Microsoft… to name a few.Laura Behrens WuFounder & CEOSimon KreuzFounder & President (GTM)Deborah AdlerGeneral CounselPatrick NikoletichChief Technology OfficerTeryle AguilarSVP, PeopleOlivier AdlerSVP, FinanceLearn more about usWomen CEOs of the Forbes 2022 Cloud 100 List2022 Forbes Best Start-Up listShippo Billion Dollar ValuationShippo x Shopify PartnershipFounder Series Interview Laura Behrens WuShippo Founding StoryYoutubeFounder’s\nField Guide PodcastWell Made PodcastWhat is Shippo and How Does it Work?Y Combinator Founders ConferenceA Fortt Knox Conversation YoutubeGet started todayEverything you need for professional-grade shipping and deep discounts from top carriers.Get startedWhat you can doCreate Shipping LabelsConnect Your ToolsManage the ExperienceGrow Your BusinessShip with ConfidencePartnersTechnology PartnersCarrier PartnersFulfillment PartnersBecome a PartnerDevelopersOverviewAPI Address ValidationAPI ReferencesAPI DocsAPI Portal LoginAPI StatusCompanyAbout UsJobsNewsroomTerms of UsePrivacy NoticeContactHelp CenterContact UsTwitterFacebookLinkedIn© Shippo 2024 | LegalYour Privacy Choices",

A good inside joke can make my day. I have never felt as appreciated & “spoiled” as I do in Freightos.Mary Abu GhattasHR Business PartnerBefore I officially started at Freightos, they sent me a gift for Eid. And again, when my daughter Salma was born, which really meant a lot to me. Managers here are close and accessible. There isn’t a gap between employee and manager like at other companies.Oday AshourSoftware Development EngineerOn an individual level, there are budgets for training, and team building. On a professional level, there are opportunities to learn new technologies, to investigate and experiment. At Freightos, they don’t say, “it can’t be done this way”.

About UsREAD OUR STORYOur StoryOur story isn't one of sexy, Silicon Valley unicorns. It's one of grit, determination, and a rapidly changing marketplace.Amazon IPO'd the year I graduated from high school. Since then, it has felt like the speed of advancement has accelerated every year, leaving virtually everyone else behind.After college I bought a small pack and ship store where I found myself right in the middle of this global transformation. Shipping software was old, the results were unpredictable, and my customers were counting on me to have all the answers. My phone was literally ringing off the hook with customers asking me the same question, \"What is the shipping cost?\"Most of today's shippers find that their second highest expense, second only to cost-of-goods, is shipping! Yet they are entering each transaction blind. They have inaccurate data and their entry-level shipping software lacks the controls they need to impact these costs. ShipHawk was founded to level the playing field, to give control back to the shippers, the retailers, manufacturers, and distributors who need these levers to stay competitive.The stakes have never been higher. Our mission is to create a world where shipping positively impacts society without thrashing workers, our environment, or the bottom line.Today we do this by focusing on warehouse automations specifically around parcel and LTL order fulfillment, but we won't stop building until our customers have equal access to enterprise-level efficiencies throughout the supply chain.Jeremy Bodenhamer Co-founder & CEOREAD MOREOur History2012ShipHawk is Founded ShipHawk was founded on October 16, 2012.2013TechCrunch DisruptShipHawk won the Audience Choice Award at TechCrunch Disrupt in 2013.2015Kyiv Office OpenedIn May 2015, ShipHawk opened an office in Kyiv.2017SDCE Green Supply Chain AwardIn 2017, ShipHawk won the Green Supply Chain Award by Supply and Demand Chain Executive.2017Deloitte Technology Fast 500In 2017, ShipHawk ranked #8 on Deloitte's Technology Fast 500.2017 and 2018 Inc. 5000ShipHawk ranked #12 on the 2017 Inc. 5000.ShipHawk ranked #192 on the 2018 Inc. 5000. 2012ShipHawk is Founded ShipHawk was founded on October 16, 2012.2013TechCrunch DisruptShipHawk won the Audience Choice Award at TechCrunch Disrupt in 2013.2015Kyiv Office OpenedIn May 2015, ShipHawk opened an office in Kyiv.2017SDCE Green Supply Chain AwardIn 2017, ShipHawk won the Green Supply Chain Award by Supply and Demand Chain Executive.2017Deloitte Technology Fast 500In 2017, ShipHawk ranked #8 on Deloitte's Technology Fast 500.2017 and 2018 Inc. 5000ShipHawk ranked #12 on the 2017 Inc. 5000.ShipHawk ranked #192 on the 2018 Inc. 5000. 2012ShipHawk is Founded ShipHawk was founded on October 16, 2012.2013TechCrunch DisruptShipHawk won the Audience Choice Award at TechCrunch Disrupt in 2013.2015Kyiv Office OpenedIn May 2015, ShipHawk opened an office in Kyiv.2017SDCE Green Supply Chain AwardIn 2017, ShipHawk won the Green Supply Chain Award by Supply and Demand Chain Executive.2017Deloitte Technology Fast 500In 2017, ShipHawk ranked #8 on Deloitte's Technology Fast 500.2017 and 2018 Inc. 5000ShipHawk ranked #12 on the 2017 Inc. 5000.ShipHawk ranked #192 on the 2018 Inc. 5000.

Ready to talk now?Contact Us: (805) 335-2432  ShipHawk’s Company Culture: The Three H’sShare:April 3, 2015 / Claire EastburnShipHawk’s Company Culture: The Three H’sThe first thing you see when you walk through the doors at ShipHawk are the three H’s: Heart, Hustle, Humility. As Tony Hsieh, the CEO of Zappo’s said, “Your brand is your culture.” Every day at ShipHawk we strive to embody these values. They are reflected in our work, office environment, and brand identity.HeartYour work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it.—Steve Jobs Always doing what is in the customer’s best interest. We do whatever it takes to keep our customers happy. Our company culture and brand identity are a reflection of who we are as individuals, where we strive to be, and what makes ShipHawk different.Caring about the customer and all our Team Members. Customers will always be treated with respect, keeping the Golden Rule in mind. ShipHawk Team Members are a family, first and foremost. These relationships extend beyond the office, where we get to know one another on a deeper level.Communicating profoundly and deeply. One of the biggest pain points for our customers is the lack of communication when dealing with the shipping industry. To help our customers, we strive to communicate effectively and efficiently. We move beyond the surface of just asking questions by learning our customers’ stories.Having fun! Work hard, play hard. It may be work but that doesn’t mean we can’t have fun doing it. We laugh, play, prank, compete, and push each other to have fun with what we do. We have fun with our customers and have fun with one another.HustleThings may come to those who wait, but only the things left by those who hustle.—Abraham LincolnKeeping up the intensity. We are fiercely competitive and always demanding more of ourselves, our vendors, and our partners. With such high expectations of ourselves and those around us, we know they demand the same of us.Being clever. We find unique ways to solve complex problems by delivering creative solutions through our technology and customer service.Living a healthy and active lifestyle. Health is a vital part of keeping the hustle alive. By staying physically active, monitoring nutrition, and maintaining a healthy work-life balance, we are able to stay healthy, happy, and strong.Staying educated. Knowledge is power. In order to stay ahead of the curve, we learn about the latest trends in our industry. One can never know too much, so we strive to read, research, and take the initiative to become active minds and learners.HumilityHumility is the solid foundation of all virtues.—ConfuciusOwning mistakes. We admit to our failures. Turning a mistake into a lesson requires fixing it, learning from it, and developing a plan to prevent it from happening again.    Being open and honest. Everyone has their limits; it’s better to under-promise and over-deliver. Staying honest with our customers, Team Members, and ourselves keeps us grounded. If a task is too much, we get help. If we don’t know an answer, we’ll find it.Whether it’s having the heart to create innovative programming, hustling to finish a project on time, or having humility when confronted with an unhappy customer, every department and person at ShipHawk permeates the three H’s—heart, hustle, humility.TAGS: Company Culture , Heart , Humility , Hustle , ValuesPost navigation< NEWER  OLDER >Recent postsRenew Wellness Brands uses ShipHawk to reduce errorsRenew Wellness Brands uses ShipHawk to keep up with peak season10 Competencies of Best-In-Class WarehousesCapture Weights & Dims, Cut Costs with ShipHawk DimensionerProMat 2025         © ShipHawk 2024, All Rights Reserved     Fulfillment Management SolutionsWarehouse Management SystemReceive, Putaway, & Cross-DockPick OptimizationCycle CountShipping SoftwarePacking OptimizationShipping Rate OptimizationShipping APIShopping Cart Shipping SoftwareParcel & Freight AuditShipHawk DimensionerERP IntegrationsNetSuite – WMSNetSuite – ShippingAcumatica – WMSAcumatica – ShippingInfor – WMSInfor – ShippingMicrosoft Dynamics – WMSMicrosoft Dynamics – ShippingSage – WMSSage – ShippingSAP – WMSSAP – ShippingResourcesResources, Events and WebinarsCustomer StoriesBlogShipping CarriersAbout UsCareersSystem StatusContact UsPressPrivacy Policy    [brb_collection id=\"14947\"]",

About UsREAD OUR STORYOur StoryOur story isn't one of sexy, Silicon Valley unicorns. It's one of grit, determination, and a rapidly changing marketplace.Amazon IPO'd the year I graduated from high school. Since then, it has felt like the speed of advancement has accelerated every year, leaving virtually everyone else behind.After college I bought a small pack and ship store where I found myself right in the middle of this global transformation. Shipping software was old, the results were unpredictable, and my customers were counting on me to have all the answers. My phone was literally ringing off the hook with customers asking me the same question, \"What is the shipping cost?\"Most of today's shippers find that their second highest expense, second only to cost-of-goods, is shipping! Yet they are entering each transaction blind. They have inaccurate data and their entry-level shipping software lacks the controls they need to impact these costs. ShipHawk was founded to level the playing field, to give control back to the shippers, the retailers, manufacturers, and distributors who need these levers to stay competitive.The stakes have never been higher. Our mission is to create a world where shipping positively impacts society without thrashing workers, our environment, or the bottom line.Today we do this by focusing on warehouse automations specifically around parcel and LTL order fulfillment, but we won't stop building until our customers have equal access to enterprise-level efficiencies throughout the supply chain.Jeremy Bodenhamer Co-founder & CEOREAD MOREOur History2012ShipHawk is Founded ShipHawk was founded on October 16, 2012.2013TechCrunch DisruptShipHawk won the Audience Choice Award at TechCrunch Disrupt in 2013.2015Kyiv Office OpenedIn May 2015, ShipHawk opened an office in Kyiv.2017SDCE Green Supply Chain AwardIn 2017, ShipHawk won the Green Supply Chain Award by Supply and Demand Chain Executive.2017Deloitte Technology Fast 500In 2017, ShipHawk ranked #8 on Deloitte's Technology Fast 500.2017 and 2018 Inc. 5000ShipHawk ranked #12 on the 2017 Inc. 5000.ShipHawk ranked #192 on the 2018 Inc. 5000. 2012ShipHawk is Founded ShipHawk was founded on October 16, 2012.2013TechCrunch DisruptShipHawk won the Audience Choice Award at TechCrunch Disrupt in 2013.2015Kyiv Office OpenedIn May 2015, ShipHawk opened an office in Kyiv.2017SDCE Green Supply Chain AwardIn 2017, ShipHawk won the Green Supply Chain Award by Supply and Demand Chain Executive.2017Deloitte Technology Fast 500In 2017, ShipHawk ranked #8 on Deloitte's Technology Fast 500.2017 and 2018 Inc. 5000ShipHawk ranked #12 on the 2017 Inc. 5000.ShipHawk ranked #192 on the 2018 Inc. 5000. 2012ShipHawk is Founded ShipHawk was founded on October 16, 2012.2013TechCrunch DisruptShipHawk won the Audience Choice Award at TechCrunch Disrupt in 2013.2015Kyiv Office OpenedIn May 2015, ShipHawk opened an office in Kyiv.2017SDCE Green Supply Chain AwardIn 2017, ShipHawk won the Green Supply Chain Award by Supply and Demand Chain Executive.2017Deloitte Technology Fast 500In 2017, ShipHawk ranked #8 on Deloitte's Technology Fast 500.2017 and 2018 Inc. 5000ShipHawk ranked #12 on the 2017 Inc. 5000.ShipHawk ranked #192 on the 2018 Inc. 5000.

We offer web-based shipping, inventory and\ndropshipping apps that help ecommerce sellers take their businesses to the next level. Our mission is to\nequip\nsmall and medium-sized businesses with apps that help accelerate their growth.\nFor over a decade, thousands of online merchants have trusted us to help them\nmanage and grow their businesses.\nFun Facts\n2010\nOrdoro launched\n15\ncurrent employees\n$1.7 billion\nGMV processed (past 12\nmonths)\n16.6 million\nSKUs tracked (past 12\nmonths)\nWant the long version?

Big Results.\nHow does a tiny team tackle the ginormous problems of the “unsexy” side of ecommerce? Simply put, we take our\njobs way more seriously than we take ourselves.\nSure, it’s a daunting mission, but we’ve rallied around it by fostering an inclusive and collaborative\nenvironment for our employees, customers, and partners. We’re VERY passionate about creating, supporting, and\nselling our software and have a lot more fun working here than we should.\nProduct\nProduct decisions are heavily-guided by customer feedback.\nEvery member of Ordoro is encouraged to record and track product feedback while interacting with\ncustomers, partners, vendors, and advisors — no matter what team they’re on. This gathered data is\nfrequently analyzed and incorporated into our monthly engineering sprints. This methodology creates a\ngreater sense of ownership of our platform and also allows us to release and iterate on features more\nefficiently. Our customers are also kept in the loop as we openly share our product roadmap with them.\nDesign\nOur Design team handles both our UI/UX as well as our graphic design.\nTheir main focuses are to design and build (yes, they actually code) elegant experiences in our platform\nwhile also pushing our brand forward by overseeing all of our creative marketing initiatives. This\nmultidisciplinary approach is crucial to the iterative methodology we practice with all of our projects\nand also lends itself to a much more cohesive brand journey for our new customers.\nEngineering\nOur Engineers work directly with all of our teams (and some customers).\nOur cross-functional Engineering team handles all things technical with the platform (building new\nfeatures, managing the infrastructure, answering api forum questions, etc) while also working closely\nwith all other groups at Ordoro for gathering requirements and testing. Truly collaborative, they work\niteratively and release code weekly, fostering a continuous feedback loop with our users.\nMarketing\nOur scrappy Marketing team is equal parts creative and equal parts analytical.\nThey love crafting authentic brand content just as much as they love analyzing how much impact it has on\ngrowing our business. They understand this is a crowded space, so they work tirelessly to reach the\nright people at the right time and showcase our unique set of offerings. By the time a potential\ncustomer is talking with our Sales team, they should be feeling pretty excited about getting on board\nwith Ordoro.\nSales\nOur Sales team’s focus is to learn your business needs to determine if Ordoro is the right\nsolution for you.\nOur Sales team’s first priority is to ensure that the potential customer and Ordoro are a good fit —\neven if that means turning some away and recommending alternative software to them. This is accomplished\nby first digging in and discovering the customer’s needs, designing the solution to meet those needs,\nand then helping the customer create a path to transition into Ordoro. They are also supported by the\nrest of the company in this endeavor. Our customers tell us that it’s a refreshing, conversational\nexperience, and we can see why.\nCustomer Support\nYou will always talk to an actual Ordoro employee when you contact Customer Support.\nThis dedicated team knows the ins-and-outs of our platform and also partners with our customers to\nunderstand the needs of their businesses. They handle all of the testing and QA of our weekly releases,\nso they’re always up to speed on new features and bug fixes that go into the wild. On top of that, when\na new customer has decided to take the plunge with us, they also help them configure their account and\ntrain them on our platform. They’re truly world-class and have the testimonials and reviews to prove it.\nMeet The Fam\nYep, this is all of us.

We offer web-based shipping, inventory and\ndropshipping apps that help ecommerce sellers take their businesses to the next level. Our mission is to\nequip\nsmall and medium-sized businesses with apps that help accelerate their growth.\nFor over a decade, thousands of online merchants have trusted us to help them\nmanage and grow their businesses.\nFun Facts\n2010\nOrdoro launched\n15\ncurrent employees\n$1.7 billion\nGMV processed (past 12\nmonths)\n16.6 million\nSKUs tracked (past 12\nmonths)\nWant the long version? Learn how we went from MBA class\nproject to self-sustaining, cash flow positive business with thousands of active customers.\nRead our Starter\nStory\n→\nSmall Team. Big Results.\nHow does a tiny team tackle the ginormous problems of the “unsexy” side of ecommerce? Simply put, we take our\njobs way more seriously than we take ourselves.\nSure, it’s a daunting mission, but we’ve rallied around it by fostering an inclusive and collaborative\nenvironment for our employees, customers, and partners. We’re VERY passionate about creating, supporting, and\nselling our software and have a lot more fun working here than we should.\nProduct\nProduct decisions are heavily-guided by customer feedback.\nEvery member of Ordoro is encouraged to record and track product feedback while interacting with\ncustomers, partners, vendors, and advisors — no matter what team they’re on. This gathered data is\nfrequently analyzed and incorporated into our monthly engineering sprints. This methodology creates a\ngreater sense of ownership of our platform and also allows us to release and iterate on features more\nefficiently. Our customers are also kept in the loop as we openly share our product roadmap with them.\nDesign\nOur Design team handles both our UI/UX as well as our graphic design.\nTheir main focuses are to design and build (yes, they actually code) elegant experiences in our platform\nwhile also pushing our brand forward by overseeing all of our creative marketing initiatives. This\nmultidisciplinary approach is crucial to the iterative methodology we practice with all of our projects\nand also lends itself to a much more cohesive brand journey for our new customers.\nEngineering\nOur Engineers work directly with all of our teams (and some customers).\nOur cross-functional Engineering team handles all things technical with the platform (building new\nfeatures, managing the infrastructure, answering api forum questions, etc) while also working closely\nwith all other groups at Ordoro for gathering requirements and testing. Truly collaborative, they work\niteratively and release code weekly, fostering a continuous feedback loop with our users.\nMarketing\nOur scrappy Marketing team is equal parts creative and equal parts analytical.\nThey love crafting authentic brand content just as much as they love analyzing how much impact it has on\ngrowing our business. They understand this is a crowded space, so they work tirelessly to reach the\nright people at the right time and showcase our unique set of offerings. By the time a potential\ncustomer is talking with our Sales team, they should be feeling pretty excited about getting on board\nwith Ordoro.\nSales\nOur Sales team’s focus is to learn your business needs to determine if Ordoro is the right\nsolution for you.\nOur Sales team’s first priority is to ensure that the potential customer and Ordoro are a good fit —\neven if that means turning some away and recommending alternative software to them. This is accomplished\nby first digging in and discovering the customer’s needs, designing the solution to meet those needs,\nand then helping the customer create a path to transition into Ordoro. They are also supported by the\nrest of the company in this endeavor. Our customers tell us that it’s a refreshing, conversational\nexperience, and we can see why.\nCustomer Support\nYou will always talk to an actual Ordoro employee when you contact Customer Support.\nThis dedicated team knows the ins-and-outs of our platform and also partners with our customers to\nunderstand the needs of their businesses. They handle all of the testing and QA of our weekly releases,\nso they’re always up to speed on new features and bug fixes that go into the wild. On top of that, when\na new customer has decided to take the plunge with us, they also help them configure their account and\ntrain them on our platform. They’re truly world-class and have the testimonials and reviews to prove it.\nMeet The Fam\nYep, this is all of us. We told you we were small!\nJagath Narayan\nCEO and Co-Founder\nSince 2010\nMatt Omohundro\nDesign Director\nSince 2012\nKristen Tan\nDirector of Customer Success\nSince 2012\nDustin Moore\nSr. Frontend Engineer\nSince 2014\nSophie Hernandez\nDirector of Engineering\nSince 2015\nMarissa “Tio” Wiseman\nProduct Manager\nSince 2015\nSeth York\nSr. Software Engineer\nSince 2018\nKyle Berthusen\nImplementation Manager\nSince 2018\nBrian Everett\nDirector of Sales\nSince 2019\nCharlene Warnock\nSr. Customer Success Leader\nSince 2019\nJim LeRose\nChief Revenue Officer\nSince 2022\nDanny Greenup\nAccount Manager\nSince 2023\nAudrey Savad\nCustomer Success Leader\nSince 2024\nWilliam Simons\nCustomer Success Leader\nSince 2024 (prev. 2016-2022)\nJennifer Lozano\nMarketing Specialist\nSince 2024\nJoin us!

They gave us clear visibility of Spot rates. Other products and features like live schedules, track and trace, and analytics have helped us to support and understand our customers. Incorporating their new product updates keeps us ahead of our competitors. Happy with their fortnightly check calls guaranteeing customer satisfaction.Claudia CuevasPricing & Overseas Manager60+Reviews from our most satisfied customers.So far the Freightify platform has been a great help to our company. In it we have been able to consult rates quickly without the need to go to each platform, so far we have not had problems using it. Paul SandovalNorth Trade Team LeaderObtaining the right prices to quote our customers used to be a cumbersome process for our team. Freightify has managed to simplify that process for us by fetching all our contracts and spot prices on one screen. We recently won several shipments because we had visibility on our pricing to send out a competitive quote quickly.Christopher JessenChief Commercial OfficerIn the search for a quoting platform to assist our local ocean freight operation and sales teams with essential insights into carrier spot prices and our contracted rates, Freightify exceeded our expectations. We immediately noticed a \"customer comes first\" philosophy and a desire to innovate and enhance both their platform and our general customer experience. They are a key vendor and partner to NTG Air & Ocean because of their hands-on approach, client involvement in product development, and competitive pricing. Freightify helps us in our quest to provide high-quality service to our customers.Jan Lundahl JensenHead of Ocean Freight Procurement & Product/ Head of Agents & NetworksThe platform from Freightify is easy to use and very responsive. We can query for rates within seconds, and it helps digitalise our company by providing access to our customers. To top it all they have a very good Customer Success Team that helps us ease into the system at our convenience.Hans Peter LangkildeCountry ManagerOnboarding on Freightify was the best part of this project. It was entirely seamless and professional. A robust platform ever. Their rate and quote management workflows have absolutely simplified our pre-shipment activities. I should admit that their automated rate sheet conversion is impeccable.Amit PatelGeneral ManagerWe are extremely happy about having selected Freightify as a strategic partner for the future. Great product and team. Even though we are not their easiest customer as we are very high-demanding for our partners, we have only seen friendly faces on the other side. They have even incorporated certain requests from our side and have customised the platform accordingly. We are happy about our choice and can only recommend others to do the same.Tijs GrauwetSales and MarketingWe wanted a system to view all our carrier rates with associated charges in one place, and Freightify was the right choice for us. Everything is transparent and visible under one roof.  Extremely happy with their bi-weekly follow-up calls. All our feedback was considered then and there. Freightify, our new set of eyes, has re-energised our business. Conor LoughranManaging DirectorBesides Freightify being a simple and easy platform to use, it saves time as a procurement management tool that enables and empowers our team for quick turn-around times to our customers, with options. The onboarding process was efficient, quick and painless, the aftercare and ongoing engagement with the Freightify Team on future enhancements and development remains fantastic.Heinrich ElsManaging DirectorFreightify has made our rate searches much faster. Website and Spot rates are explicit with API and bot solutions, and thus rate management has become hassle-free.  Excellent in converting and simplifying the FAK-rate sheets. Very active and responsive team and outstanding customer service. Ilona BouwmannSales Analyst/ ECMWe are very pro-digitisation and finally found a great platform to work with to enhance our sales performance.

In addition to this, it includes track and trace solutions that help freight forwarders in getting  live location of vessels and automated milestones within seconds.“For too long, freight forwarders have been restricted to spreadsheets and legacy processes to do business. We set up Frieghtify to remove the heavy lifting of manually providing quotations, accepting email/telephonic bookings, managing documentation, coordinating and tracking shipments. Freightify solves these challenges by giving them and their customers a live pricing platform like the ones used by travelers to compare airfares, showing real-time rates on a single screen. Freight forwarders are like the travel agents for global trade, however, air travel is not as complicated as global trade. Supply chains require experts to manage cargo throughout the entire lifecycle and freight forwarders play a vital role in greasing the wheels.”Raghavendran Viswanathan, CEO of FreightifyOur InvestorsOur VisionTo Make Global Trade Better For EveryoneOur MissionFreightify is focused on democratising freight services through technology.We build customer friendly experiences, develop infrastructure and intelligent freight tools giving companies the ability to transact online that enables seamless global trade.‍TRUSTED BY200+ Forwarders From 45+ CountriesHow We Stand Apart?Why Freightify ?Our Competitive AdvantagesStrong Team with Scaling ExperienceManagement and senior staff come with very strong experience of working at fast growing startups or industry leading companiesTech, Product & Process ExpertiseDeep Domain knowledge, Strong functional expertise and Industry know-how across the organization gives an edge in the marketGlobal Presence and ApproachTeam of 200+ present in 9 countriesCustomers in more than 45 countriesPartners in more than 20 countriesFreightify's Leadership TeamThe Founder and CEO, Raghav, comes with rich experience of working in logistics, supply chain and freight management with companies including DHL and Panalpina. ‍The company’s management and senior staff come from backgrounds including :SaaS startups like Freshworks and GoFrugalLogistics tech startups like Fourkites and TrimbleShipping lines like Maersk and MSCLarge forwarders and logistics companies like CON-LINQ ApS, Dachser Denmark and WizEx - Founders / Entrepreneurs in SaaS (Including Freight technology space)Big 4 consulting firms like BCGFast growing startups like GrouponLeading companies in their space like BNY Mellon, AmazonRaghavendran ViswanathanCEOAadithya VHead, Investments & StrategyPeter GydeHead: GTM and Partnerships Swami NatrajanChief Product OfficerSrinivasan SChief Technology OfficerJesper JohansenVice President of Growth - Germany + BeneluxAnupam MundhraChief Financial OfficerHenry TrotmanVice President of Growth - EuropeVijaykumar BVice President - OperationsClaus-Robert HeinzeSVP: Enterprise Product & Professional ServicesWalk with us on this JourneyWant to Join the Rocketship at Freightify ?Freightify's ValuesPeople FirstXDo the Right ThingWhether it is during a trial / POC or a demo or during onboarding or ongoing technical support, get unprecedented support and Be The CustomerDon't worry about having different systems that don't talk to each other.
