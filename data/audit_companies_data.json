Even the largest and most profitable companies can point to processes they’re not happy with, or ones that create unnecessary friction and delays. Others have gaps they’re simply not sure how to fill. And when employees don’t have the time or know-how to implement new processes or improve their current ones, efficiency and visibility suffer—as do profit margins.\nTo help shippers make the right decisions for their business, we are launching a new series of articles exploring how tackling key issues related to your people, processes, and technology can help a company tighten its existing logistics program and plug any gaps. We’ll look at everything from technology, cloud-based tools, and automation to global capabilities and regionally customized compliance measures—right down to how you onboard these new systems and how you take on economic uncertainty (and we won’t hide the fact that, of course, we’d like to partner up in doing that).\nWith strong and reliable systems in place, a shipper’s logistics operations can hum along nicely even with minimal oversight—freeing up staff to focus on other business-critical tasks. Let’s start with the big picture…\nEnsure end-to-end capability—even if it’s not needed right now\nYou want to take a holistic view that truly addresses every aspect of your logistics operations. That encompasses everything from selecting carriers and scheduling pick-ups to tracking shipments and paying and auditing freight bills.\nMaximize options that let you shift your workload by partnering with a logistics provider that could conceivably handle everything. A wider range of capabilities lets you lean on the provider for more support if and when you need it. For example, you might initially want help with freight claims management, but later realize your process for managing and selecting carriers could also be improved. Your team can then collaborate with your provider to replace or optimize that process. Or, you could take that task off your team’s plate: the logistics provider could manage that process entirely, allowing employees to focus their energies elsewhere.\nAs the economy shifts, demand shifts with it. As your needs change, having the ability to flex will help you stay competitive.\nPartnership becomes key because, whether you need to expand capability, increase capacity, or share responsibilities, you may not have the time or resources to research and vet individual vendors. Nor will you want the inherent challenges of integrating a lot of different tools, which can further complicate processes and create barriers to data visibility right when you need it most.\nThink longer-term—logistics needs will evolve, so the company must, too\nJust because a process works well today doesn’t mean it will tomorrow. As a company’s logistics needs evolve, so too must its processes. Otherwise, the same processes that could support a company’s growth will ultimately only hold it back.\nBuild institutional knowledge into partner-vendor relationships. Besides finding support if your immediate needs change, it’s easier to plan for the future with a long-term relationship. The unforeseen is always the disruptor, and peace of mind comes from knowing that partner vendors know your business through and through, so adaptation is easy as you compete and scale.\nFor example, if a shipper acquires another company, its logistics provider can help to establish new processes and streamline the transition. Without that support, the shipper’s existing processes might rapidly break down, leading to delays and difficulties that could set the acquisition timeline back—and damage customers’ trust.\nGo for the complete array—don’t settle\nSome providers only specialize in one aspect of logistics management. But at CTSI-Global, we believe that the best providers have wide-reaching expertise and can roll with whatever clients need in the moment, from fully managed services, to moving freight, to putting solid processes in place and taking over processes you don’t have the bandwidth to manage—making it possible for them to create, maintain, and continuously improve any and all processes that a shipper requires.\nWith more than 60 years’ experience spanning all aspects of logistics management, we are in a prime position to support shippers’ immediate and long-term needs—and help them level up their operations. We focus on building efficiency and visibility into our clients’ processes at every step, so they can focus on growing their business.\nChoose a provider that supports every piece of the logistics puzzle.

These days, it’s not just about which carrier can deliver goods on time […]\nProtect Your Transportation Data from Modern Cyber Threats\nToday, no organization is immune to cyber threats, and securing transportation management data is more critical than ever. Bad actors are becoming increasingly sophisticated, deploying ransomware, generating convincing phishing attacks, and orchestrating data breaches with alarming frequency. The shipping lifecycle contains a wealth of sensitive information—freight contracts, supply chain data, client information, and more—making shippers […]\nParcel Management Analytics Translate to Better Decision-Making\nAlthough global supply chain management is often viewed from the context of enormous freight shipments, the little packages matter too. In fact, accurate and timely parcel management—typically reserved for packages weighing less than 150 pounds—is crucial for maintaining business continuity, supply chain efficiency, and customer satisfaction. As e-commerce and international trade continue to thrive, optimized […]\nUnderstand the Anatomy of a High-Performing Logistics Team\nIn modern business, logistics teams are much more than the people who move products from point A to point B. They are strategic partners that contribute directly to an organization’s success and growth. As consumer expectations rise and supply chains grow more complex, businesses need a well-rounded logistics team that can deliver efficiency, precision, and […]\nAddress Validation Tech Is Key for Thriving in B2B E-Commerce\nAs the B2B world continues to move toward e-commerce—a trend fueled both by the pandemic and B2C giants like Amazon—fast and transparent deliveries have become the endgame for success. But all the planning, routing, and real-time tracking in the world won’t matter if the delivery address is inaccurate. Today, address validation is a complicated game, […]\nMinimize Rates Across Transport Modes with Intelligent TMS Pivots\nManaging shipping costs is critical to upholding supply chain efficiency, profitability, and customer satisfaction. But optimizing rates across diverse transport modes—from road and rail to air and ocean freight—presents a range of challenges and complications, especially overwhelming for busy logistics teams. Technology provides a way forward, allowing supply chain managers to strategically reduce costs through […]\nContract Scanning is the Foundation of Modern Freight Management\nAs shippers scale, they become responsible for an ever-increasing volume of documents, including hundreds—or even thousands—of contracts, invoices, and order forms. At this volume, paper-based organization becomes simply impractical. Businesses struggle to maintain full visibility and insight into intricate agreements—especially when they work with many carriers and other partners across disparate markets and regions. While basic […]\nPrevent Misdeliveries with Efficient, Accurate Shipping Labels\nE-commerce is here to stay—and with rising demand for timely, accurate deliveries, it’s more important than ever for businesses to master parcel management. After all, transparency throughout the shipping process is no longer a perk; it’s an expectation. Proper shipping labels are foundational to meeting these expectations, enabling businesses to monitor parcels from the moment […]\nA TMS Leverages Multi-Stop Routing to Optimize Every Load\nToday’s global supply chains often look more like intricate webs than linear paths. As businesses continue to expand their reach across borders and continents, the need to simplify and optimize transportation management becomes more pressing—and more complex. One way supply chain managers can streamline operations is by implementing multi-stop routing, which combines multiple deliveries in […]\nThe Ideal Parcel Contract Process: Negotiation Expertise Unlocks Savings\nA parcel contract is far more negotiable than many shippers realize. Though parcel carriers may present their terms as fixed, there is often room to tailor elements such as rates, surcharges, and service conditions to better fit shippers’ budgets and needs. But parcel contracts can also be complex. What’s more, carriers typically have the upper […]\nLower Parcel Shipping Costs with Tailored Negotiation Support\nOf all the complexities that shape parcel contracts, nothing impacts the direction of negotiations quite like pricing. After all, those final numbers determine an organization’s overall profitability, especially if parcel volumes increase after agreements have been signed. To protect their bottom line and maintain a competitive edge, shippers must secure favorable rates and minimize parcel […]\n1\n2\n3\n…\n44\nNext »\nVital, on-the-spot intelligence–one proud client at a time.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nDeep automation—fueled by robust data and clever analytics—will power the supply chain and freight industries of the 21st century.\nSERVICES\nFREIGHT AUDIT + PAY\nHONEYBEE TMS\nPARCEL MANAGEMENT\nLOGISTICS MGMT.\nSTRATEGIC DATA\nSERVICES\n× FREIGHT AUDIT + PAY\nHONEYBEE TMS\nPARCEL MANAGEMENT\nLOGISTICS MGMT.\nSTRATEGIC DATA\nCARRIERS\nCARRIER SERVICES\nCarrier Registration\nInvoice Statuses\nService Desk\nCARRIERS\n× CARRIER SERVICES\nCarrier Registration\nInvoice Statuses\nService Desk\nABOUT US\nABOUT US\nGlobal Business\nLeadership\nCorporate Responsibility\nCareers\nWhy CTSI-Global?\nABOUT US\n× ABOUT US\nGlobal Business\nLeadership\nCorporate Responsibility\nCareers\nWhy CTSI-Global?\nUse Cases\nABOUT US\nFreight Pay + TMS\nLTL Negotiation\nABOUT US\n× Freight Pay + TMS\nLTL Negotiation\nNEWS\nNEWS\nArticles\nPress Releases\nSuccess Stories\nNEWS\n× NEWS\nArticles\nPress Releases\nSuccess Stories\nBlog Hits\nSuccessful Parcel Negotiations Call for an Expert Partner\nUnlock Foolproof Shipments with the Right Execution Strategies\nCustomized Logistics Technology: It’s Not Optional Anymore\nSearch for:\nCONTACT\nCONTACT\nClient Login\nMedia Kit\nCONTACT\n× CONTACT\nClient Login\nMedia Kit\nPrivacy Policy · Terms of Service · GDPR Policy\n© 1996-2024 · CTSI-Global · Continental Traffic Service, Inc. · FOUNDED 1957",

        "text": "Freight FAQs | Orca Intelligence Inc\n1.833.211.1197Contact us\nWhy orca?\nAbout Us\nSocial Corporate Responsibility\nFreight Audit & Analytics\nOverview\nFreight Audit\nFreight Payment\nFreight Claims Processing\nFreight Rating\nFreight Invoice Management\nFreight Accounting\nSupply Chain Analytics\nResources\nArticles\nVideos\nCarbon Calculator\nBlog\nFAQ\nContact Us\nFreight Audit FAQs\nAbout Freight Audit & Analytics\nWhat is Freight Auditing?\nFreight auditing is essential for companies that ship goods in high volumes to customers through carrier companies. It is a manual or automated process that encompasses deduplicating and clarifying invoices, identifying and correcting carrier errors and monitoring and managing transportation expenses. When up to 90% of carrier invoices arrive with errors, a key aim of freight auditing is to make sure you never overpay.\nWhy do I need Freight Auditing?\nIn addition to verifying that carrier invoices are 100% correct before payment, freight auditing ensures your goods are reaching your customers in a timely, cost-efficient manner. Auditing freight bills will guarantee that all charges your company makes are legitimate and fair for all parties involved and help you maintain good relationships with both your customers and the carriers you choose. A good freight auditing solution will also provide custom analytics that give you complete visibility over your supply chain. This will empower you and your team with the critical intel required to better manage processes and costs to optimize profitability.\nWhat does Freight Audit & Analytics Software actually do?\nThe software presents an economical way to avoid individually processing each freight bill. It can help companies of all sizes, but it is ideal for those responsible for hundreds of shipments every month. Freight audit & analytics software automates manual freight bill audit and payment (FBAP) processes, such as data collection, invoice review and supply chain reporting. It correctly classifies freights, verifies base rates, ensures discounts and/or accessorials have been correctly applied, ensures compliance with tax laws and checks that the correct fees and tariffs have been included. Finally, it confirms the amount for accuracy before payment is run.\nOn the analytics side, good freight audit and analytics software includes customizable, interactive dashboards that give full supply chain visibility. This will help you select the most cost-efficient carrier, discover patterns of incorrect charges, benchmark and optimize processes and visualize how expenses are affecting overall cost of goods sold in real-time – all to maximize profitability.\nWhat makes Orca’s Freight Audit and Analytics solution better?\nWith Orca, you’re investing in a partner, not a service. Our Freight Audit & Analytics solution automates your freight payables process, eliminates overpaying and collects and consolidates your data. But we go a big step further. We get to know your business needs, and we customize our tools, services and processes to help you achieve your goals sooner.\nThe Orca system goes above and beyond the typical, with analysis customized to run different scenario models for you. Our system recognizes patterns, compares costs of alternative carriers and sums up total potential savings or optimized costs. It drills right down to the SKU level, exposing the true cost to serve each customer you have, with each product that they order from you.\nWhy should I use Orca over handling freight audits internally?\nNo matter how meticulous your team is, there is just no way that manual auditing will come close to catching the carrier invoicing errors that our software detects and eliminates. We ensure that your invoices are 100% correct, and our highly skilled freight audit team will resolve all discrepancies with your vendors on your behalf, saving you time and money.\nAnd we’re not just an auditor, Orca’s solution is an integrated supply chain technology that helps create efficiencies and reduce costs. No more stacks of invoicing issues to correct or accessorial charges to approve. Our solution frees up your logisticians to generate true business value, using the real-time data we provide on custom dashboards mapped to your critical KPIs.\nWhat analytics does Orca’s Freight Audit and Analytics solution provide?\nThe Orca system was built for the effective management of supply chain processes, including payables, data auditing, freight analytics and supply chain decision-based modelling. We give you a holistic view of your entire supply chain network, including a carrier scorecard, cost-to-sell analysis, customer summary, GL analysis and budgetary tracking. We custom-tailor the analytics and reporting to your unique business goals and the KPIs of your choosing. This leads to more relevant insights and higher cost savings.\nOur solution provides each customer with the opportunity to push us to new technological advancements. We urge our clients to get creative, brainstorm with us and help us understand the different ways they look at the various divisions of their supply chain. We then take ideas and recommendations back to our dev team to continue to innovate the output our technology can offer. Most recently, we have taken on AI and ML projects which will continuously recognize patterns of shipping and create efficiency opportunities for our clients.\nJust how much customization do you offer?\nOur customization is what truly sets us apart. Our Freight Audit & Analytics software cleans your data, analyzes it and presents it on dashboards that are fully customizable to your requirements. We also help you set up interactive reports and dashboards, including personalized filters that allow you to choose and track KPIs based on the business goals you need to achieve.\nWhen a client asks if we can do something out of the ordinary, we thank them for leading us to a new potential solution and accept the challenge. Our IT leaders all have supply chain backgrounds, which makes new challenges a great way to continuously push the envelope and create new industry best practices.\nHow do I get started with Orca?\nThere are no upfront or monthly payments. The savings we recover from your vendors will pay for the entire service in year one. Orca is one of best freight audit companies providing this option. Simply contact us to start saving.\nWant to optimize your supply chain and become more profitable?\nGet started now\nGeneral Parcel Freight Bill Audit\nWhich parcel carriers does Orca audit?\nOrca audits invoices from UPS, FedEx, Canada Post, Purolator, Canpar, Loomis, USPS, DHL, as well as smaller regional providers. We are there to ensure that every shipping bill is 100% accurate.\nDoes Orca guarantee to reduce parcel freight costs?\nYes. As many as 90% of carrier invoices contain errors. As your freight audit partner, we ensure we have a clear understanding of your business in order to identify all carrier errors and recover those costs for you.\nHow can I track my freight savings as a result of using Orca?\nCarrier refunds generated by our Freight Audit & Analytics solution are applied directly to your accounts. Unlike other companies, we don’t make you wait for a weekly report. Instead, we provide ongoing real-time updates detailing carrier credits, so you have complete visibility. Plus, every invoice audit is accompanied by a complete audit trail.\nWhat is Orca’s freight Audit & Analytics solution looking for on each invoice?\nCarriers often overcharge due to service failures and billing mistakes. The most common billing errors relate to packages manifested but not shipped, late deliveries, erroneous dimensional weight charges, duplicate charges, incorrect delivery area surcharges, failure to receive proof of delivery and more. Our software and freight audit specialists review critical elements on every line of your carrier invoices so you never overpay.\nHow much time does it take to implement Orca’s Freight Audit & Analytics solution and what do you need from my team\nOnboarding innovative new systems and processes takes time, but they are imperative to improving your supply chain and transportation networks. At Orca, we take on the heavy lifting. At the same time, we consult with your teams on a regular basis to set goals and ensure that processes, rules, rate agreements and other essential elements are aligned with your operation and requirements.\nWe seamlessly integrate our software with your systems, including any enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution, warehouse management system (WMS) or in-house software. Our processes are also custom-built to your company’s needs and with minimal change to your current operation. We can discuss timing with you on a case-by-case basis.\nPost-implementation, how much time will we need to dedicate to managing the freight auditing process?\nOnce we’ve implemented Orca’s Freight Audit & Analytics solution you will immediately begin to see cost savings on your shipments. No time is required on your part to facilitate ongoing audits.\nAnd unlike other companies, we don’t make you wait for weekly reports. We deliver up-to-the-minute intelligence on demand. You will receive immediate information in real time, including credits applied resulting from our audits. If there are invoicing disputes, our freight audit experts will work with your carriers to solve discrepancies and request credits on your behalf, saving your team valuable time and money.\nHow is Orca different from other parcel freight audit and analytics companies?\nWith Orca, you’re investing in a partner, not a service.

We bring a fresh view to the industry, focusing on innovation, advanced analytics and unmatched client experience. Our number one priority is to add value every day by going above and beyond.\nWhat kind of reporting and analytics does Orca offer?\nWhen you implement Orca’s Freight Audit & Analytics solution you have the following real-time reporting at your fingertips:\nFreight network analysis\nCarrier scorecard\nAccessorial analysis\nCustomer summary\nRevenue analysis\nSKU analysis\nTotal landed cost reporting\nWe then customize your reporting and analytics to your business needs, so you can effectively manage your own distinctive supply chain processes – from payables, data auditing and freight analytics through to supply chain decision-based modelling. Our dashboards can also be personalized with filters to enable you to track the KPIs of your choosing.\nWe see ourselves as your partner, and as such, we will hold quarterly business reviews, walk you through year over year comparisons and run scenario modelling – such as projecting cost savings if you moved a DC to another city. We also have the foresight, scalability and proven expertise to help predict and meet your future business requirements. We are continually reinvesting in the future of supply chain technology, including AI and ML capabilities, to empower your supply chain with critical intelligence now and for the future.\nSome audit procedures are already handled by my company internally. Can Orca supplement these with limited auditing that includes only what our internal audits don’t cover?\nAt Orca, we see ourselves as your business partner. We are happy to make customizations to our Freight Audit & Analytics solution to accommodate your business requirements.\nHow will implementing a parcel audit service impact my company’s relationships and service levels with carriers?\nYour relationships with carriers will not be adversely affected by using Orca’s Freight Audit & Analytics. Carriers sometimes need reminders that they have to work to keep your business, and regular auditing is a great way to ensure they are upholding service level agreements. As a result of using Orca, many customers experience a higher level of service from their carriers.\nWe have a general service refund waiver. Is Orca still able to audit our parcel freight invoices?\nDuring contract negotiations, some carriers ask shippers to waive their rights to on-time delivery guarantees. They often do this in exchange for additional incentives in other areas of the contract. A general service refund (GSR) waiver, or money back guarantee waiver, is something you should consider seriously before signing away your rights to refunds for late deliveries. In many cases, the additional incentives could be negotiated into your contract without signing a GSR waiver.\nHowever, even if you have a GSR waiver in place, Orca’s Freight Audit & Analytics software is still able to audit your freight invoices for errors and ensure you only pay for what was agreed in your contracts. Service failures/late deliveries make up only a part of what we are looking for in your invoices. Our software not only ensures you get the refunds you deserve but also full supply chain visibility so you can optimize cost savings.\nHow much does Orca’s Freight Audit & Analytics solution cost?\nThere are no upfront or monthly payments. The savings we recover from your vendors will pay for the entire service in year one. Orca is one of the best freight audit companies providing this option. Our success is contingent upon finding you the highest possible cost savings on your freight bills.\nWant to find a freight audit partner, not a service?\nGet started now\nGeneral Truck, Rail, Ocean and Air Freight Audit\nWhat modes of freight transportation does Orca audit?\nOrca audits freight invoices from truck (LTL & FTL), rail, ocean and air shipping services. Our Freight Audit & Analytics solution analyzes every line of your invoices, identifies errors and ensures you never overpay. If there is a billing discrepancy, our audit experts will work with your carrier on your behalf to ensure you receive all credits due.\nWhat types of billing errors does Orca’s Freight Audit & Analytics solution look for?\nOur Freight Audit & Analytics software reviews critical elements on every line of your carrier invoices so you never pay more than you should. Orca detects errors such as duplicate invoices, invalid accessorial charges, incorrect tariffs, service level failures, carrier routing non-compliance and much more.\nWhat freight cost recovery percentage can we expect from Orca?\nFreight cost recovery percentages can vary widely based on the transportation mode, the carrier, the product being shipped and more. Some freight audits can recover 1% in savings, others can be as high as 10%.\nHow far back can Orca go to look for erroneous freight billings?\nEach transportation mode has its own statute of limitations for filing for freight billing errors. Air freight and LTL shipments typically have a six-month window, while FTL shipments have one to two years. Ocean freight and rail freight invoice audits can go as far back as 3 years before the statute runs out.\nCan Orca conduct secondary freight bill audits?\nYes. Orca’s Freight Audit & Analytics solution is comprehensive and thorough. We are able to uncover billing errors and cost savings that less advanced solutions miss. Don’t leave money on the table. If you would like us to conduct secondary audits of your freight bills, we would be happy to help.\nDoes Orca audit paper freight invoices, in addition to electronic ones?\nYes. Whether presented with paper or electronic invoices, our freight auditing is extremely thorough. We ensure that your invoices are 100% correct, and our highly skilled freight audit team will resolve all discrepancies with your vendors on your behalf, saving you time and money.\nHow much does Orca’s Freight Audit & Analytics solution cost?\nThere are no upfront or monthly payments. The savings we recover from your carriers will pay for the entire service in year one. Orca is one of the best freight audit companies providing this option. Our success is contingent upon finding you the highest possible cost savings on your freight bills.\nWant to maximize your freight cost savings?\nGet started now\nGeneral Parcel Freight Contract Negotiations\nMy contracts include the lowest possible shipping rates. How can Orca help me save more?\nAlthough you may have been very thorough in your contract negotiations, Orca’s Freight Audit & Analytics software and in-house experts have the data from thousands of contracts to back them up. Our software is able to conduct advanced analytics based not only on price, but on cost to carriers, terms of service and more. With our deep analytics paired with our contract negotiation expertise, we are able to pinpoint areas in your contracts where you can improve your position and achieve higher benefits.\nNegotiating is my specialty. Why should I hire Orca to negotiate my contracts when I can do it myself?\nOrca’s team is not only expert at contract negotiations, but they have the powerful insight of Orca’s freight analytics backing them. An effective contract negotiation requires the analysis of many data points, and Orca’s analytics are proven to find more ways to ensure your contracts are drafted in your favour.\nHow much of my time will be required during the contract negotiation process?\nOrca provides the contract negotiation specialists and the analytics software to optimize your contract negotiations. We handle everything, from beginning to end.\nWhat if I have just signed a new carrier contract, do I need to wait for it to expire before Orca can get involved?\nCarrier contracts may have specified term lengths, but they can also be revised at any time. Orca can help you optimize negotiations when you are ready to make contract revisions. We can analyze your current contracts to find opportunities for cost savings and get you the best incentives available. We are here to help you get the most out of every one of your contracts.\nIf I use Orca’s contract negotiation services, will I need to change carriers?\nNo. Orca is there to assist you in finding the highest cost savings and optimize your contract negotiations.

Our customers find that they enjoy even better relationships with carriers after going through the Orca contract negotiation process.\nI have confidentiality agreements with my carriers. How will they affect my ability to work with Orca?\nMost carriers include confidentiality clauses in their contracts. We have structured our contract negotiating services to accommodate confidentiality commitments.\nIf Orca analyzes my carrier contracts to show me potential savings, am I obligated to Orca in any way?\nNo. We analyze your carrier contracts to uncover potential savings. It is common for companies to hire our services upon seeing their substantial freight cost reduction opportunities, but there is no obligation to do so.\nDoes Orca guarantee to reduce shipping costs through their contract negotiation services?\nYes.

This includes our time-saving back-office applications, our fully-integrated freight auditing and billing systems, our revolutionary Parcel Dimensionalizer™, and our patented Freight Innovation Density Analytics (FIDA) technology, which maximizes carrier space and speed while avoiding unexpected fees and overages.\nIn 2019, TFM acquired National Traffic Service, Inc. (NTS), an industry leader in freight auditing and payment services and software to major corporations throughout North America since 1956. Through this service, TFM processes 30 million domestic and international bills annually, representing over $1 billion in freight for over 200 companies throughout the United States and Canada.\nMike Wagner, CEOFirst-time entrepreneur Mike Wagner is extremely proud of the team he has assembled to grow TFM from the ground up.Starting from a single office in his hometown of Pittsburgh in the back of a car wash, today TFM employs over 80 people in 6 locations nationwide, including Florida, Iowa, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Texas. Along the way, TFM’s freight optimization and logistics businesses have achieved meteoric growth: between 2015 and 2019, a TFM company was ranked on the annual Inc. 500/5000 list of the fastest-growing companies in the U.S. for five straight years — a rare feat that has only been achieved by 4% of listed companies. In recognition of his leadership and vision, in 2017 TFM President and CEO Mike Wagner was named Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year.\nIn addition to transforming the shipping industry, Wagner and his team are also fully dedicated to making TFM one of the best workplaces in the country. TFM has repeatedly been voted as one of the Best Places to Work in Pittsburgh, and also ranked as the city’s Fastest-Growing Company.

If you have a question, we can answer it. Below are some of our most frequently asked questions and answers.\nHave another question? Fill out the form below and you’ll get your answer.\nWhat is 3PL?3PL stands for third-party logistics. 3PL providers offer a variety of outsourced logistics services to their customers, including inventory, storage, distribution, transportation, and fulfillment. They enable their customers to accomplish large-scale business projects without needing to retain all of that specialized talent in-house. By leveraging existing relationships with multiple service providers throughout the global supply chain, 3PL providers can often achieve significant savings that their individual customers would not be able to obtain on their own. What's the difference between FTL, LTL, and Parcel?There are many different kinds of freight shipment options available to most shippers, including Full Truckload (FTL), Less Than Truckload (LTL), and Parcel. FTL shipments typically take up an entire truck or shipping container and are priced by the full shipping unit. LTL shipments can be anything from two packages to the majority of space in a shared truckload or container, and are often spread across multiple vehicles or carriers in order to find optimal per-segment pricing. Parcel shipments typically refer to smaller individual deliveries — think Amazon, FedEx, or UPS.What is a Transportation Management System (TMS) and how does it work?A Transportation Management System (TMS) is an online freight scheduling and shipping system that enables a client to manage order fulfillment, shipping, carrier communications, invoicing, claims, and customer service all within the same interconnected digital application. Target Freight’s clients can access our proprietary TMS through API calls, which enable them to create custom links and applications that help their customers track orders and maintain greater visibility of their supply chain.How easy is it to start using Target Freight Management's TMS?\nWe work with every new TFM client to assess their needs and propose the right suite of services to help streamline their shipping process and save them time and money at every step along the way. While every client’s custom onboarding process is different, our clients are typically up and running confidently on our TMS in just a few weeks, and seeing measurable freight savings within the first 30 days. You can learn more about our transportation management system here.\nDoes Target Freight's TMS integrate with clients' proprietary ERP systems?\nYes, our TMS can be customized to integrate with a shipper’s existing ERP system to ensure full visibility and shared data access at every point in the process.\nHow many carriers does TFM work with?Target Freight works with all the major providers within the LTL and Parcel space as well as thousands of FTL carriers throughout North America, which ensures that our clients always enjoy competitive pricing for all of their freight needs.What is freight auditing?In short, freight auditing means properly accounting for every package you send, from order and shipping through delivery and payment. It is the process of reviewing all paperwork for a shipment in order to ensure that all units were delivered, all carrier pricing agreements were adhered to, any claims or additional fees that were assessed are accepted and/or disputed, and that all revenues and expenses are processed under the correct billing codes.What are the benefits of using a freight auditing and payment service?The two biggest benefits of using freight auditing and payment services are saving time and saving money. You can save hundreds or hours and tens of thousands of dollars on shipping and reporting year after year. We audit your bills before payment for accuracy, reduce your administrative accounting expenses and manage your payment and logistics data within the same auditing system. Automation reduces mistakes. Any “red flags” noted by the technology are then checked by our team. Learn more about our freight auditing and payment services here.Are TFM’s freight audit and payment services safe and easy to use?\nYes, one of our client service representatives will be happy to work with you to get you quickly and painlessly onboarded with our freight auditing and payment services. Getting all of your carriers converted to use our system typically takes 30-45 days. During this process, you will provide us with your current carrier rates and agreements, shipping locations, business rules, etc. We will provide you with a letter to send to your carriers notifying them of the change in billing address. We will also coordinate all communications with your carriers to receive electronic (EDI) invoices.\nOnce everything is set up, you can use our online freight auditing and payment service to start creating queries and running customized reports in just a few minutes. All of your information is kept confidential in our secure system. And if you have any questions, your client service representative is happy to help.\nWhat makes someone a preferred shipper?\nEvery freight carrier has their own criteria for what makes a customer a “preferred shipper,” but earning this status is generally the result of a shipper following a carrier’s best practices. This typically includes having a clear understanding of the types and volumes of freight that a carrier prefers to transport, submitting a fully complete request for quote (RFQ) which includes all relevant information that a carrier needs to quickly and accurately price a shipment bid, responding to questions and customer service concerns swiftly and comprehensively, and other practices that help carriers save time and reduce complications. Working with a 3PL like Target Freight gives our clients the inside track to becoming preferred shippers at the thousands of carriers we work with, which helps ensure their shipments will be managed for optimal turnaround.\nWANT TO LEARN MORE?\nDon’t see a question or answer you’re looking for?\nFill out this form to get a conversation started.\nBottom Contact Form\nSection\nName\n*\nEmail\n*\nPhone\nMessage\nIf you are human, leave this field blank.\nSubmit\nCopyright 2022 Target Freight Management.

We aim to provide you with the best shipping options, competitive rates, and excellent customer service.

Our dedicated team works hard to find the best solutions for your shipping needs, ensuring your packages arrive safely and on time. We know that reliable shipping is crucial for your success, and that’s why our mission matters. It’s about helping you achieve your goals with confidence and ease, knowing that your shipping is in good hands.\nOur History\nThe Beginning of FreightCenter\nFreightCenter’s story began with a family-owned shipping and packaging store called “Send It Packing,” run by Matthew and his father, James Brosious. They started this small business with a vision to simplify the complex world of freight shipping for companies and individuals. Working from a modest storefront, they focused on building solid relationships with carriers and customers. Their main goal was to create a one-stop solution where people could easily compare rates and services from different carriers and choose the best option for their shipping needs.\nEmbracing the Internet\nAs the internet became more popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s, FreightCenter saw an opportunity to leverage this new technology to grow their business. They developed an online platform allowing customers to get instant quotes, book shipments, and track deliveries from their computers. This was a significant shift in the freight industry, which had traditionally relied on phone calls and paper documents. By going digital, FreightCenter made shipping faster, easier, and more convenient for everyone.\nTechnological Innovations\nFreightCenter continued to invest in technology to improve its services. They developed advanced software to analyze shipping data and provide customers with the most efficient and cost-effective shipping options. This innovation helped them stand out in the industry and attract more customers. They also introduced tools like real-time tracking and automated notifications, giving customers better control over their shipments and peace of mind.\nExpanding Services\nOver the years, FreightCenter expanded its range of services to meet the diverse needs of its customers. They began offering LTL (less-than-truckload) shipping, full truckload shipping, international shipping, and intermodal shipping, which combines different modes of transportation. FreightCenter could serve a broader range of customers by providing various shipping options, from small businesses to large corporations.\nBuilding a Strong Team\nA critical factor in FreightCenter’s success has been its dedicated team of employees. The company values hard work, innovation, and excellent customer service. They have created a positive work environment where employees are encouraged to share ideas and work together to solve problems. This strong team spirit has helped FreightCenter provide outstanding customer service and maintain a competitive edge in the industry.\nCustomer-Centric Approach\nFreightCenter has always prioritized its customers. It understands that each customer has unique shipping needs and strives to provide personalized solutions. By listening to customer feedback and continuously improving its services, FreightCenter has built a loyal customer base. Its commitment to customer satisfaction is one of the reasons it has remained a trusted name in the freight shipping industry for over two decades.\nLooking to the Future\nToday, FreightCenter is a well-known and respected name in the freight shipping industry. It continues to grow and adapt to its customers’ changing needs. With a focus on technology and customer service, it is always looking for new ways to improve its services and stay ahead of the competition. FreightCenter’s history is a story of innovation, dedication, and a commitment to excellence, and it is determined to continue this legacy in the years to come.\nLearn more about\nCompare LTL Freight Rates\nOur Certifications\nAwards and Endorsements\n2021 Food Logistics’ Top Green Providers\n2021 Supply & Demand Chain Executives’ Pros to Know: Matt Brosious\n2020 Top Food Logistics’ 3PL & Cold Storage Provider Award\n2020 Business Observer’s Top 500 Companies on the Gulf Coast\n2020 SmartWay® Transport Partner\n2020 Food Logistics’ Champions: Rock Stars of the Supply Chain\n2020 Best of Palm Harbor Awards for Local Businesses\n2019 Top Food Logistics’ 3PL & Cold Storage Provider Award\n2019 Business Observer’s Top 500 Companies on the Gulf Coast\n2018 Supply & Demand Chain Executive PRO to Know\n2017 Green Supply Chain Award from Supply & Demand Chain Executive\n2017 Tampa Bay Business Journal Top 200\n2017 Food Logistics’ Champions: Rock Stars of the Supply Chain\n2017 SmartWay® Transport Partner\n2017 Tampa Bay Business Journal Heroes at Work\n2017 &2016 Food Logistics Top Green Providers\n2016, 2015, & 2012 Food Logistics Top 100 Software and Technology Providers\n2013 Jobs Added in 2013 by Tampa Bay Business Journal\n2013 Tampa Bay Business 100 by Tampa Bay Business Journal\n2013 Top 100 Great Supply Chain Partners by SupplyChainBrain\n2012 TIA Samaritan Award Honorable Mention\n2012, 2011 & 2010 TBBJ Fast 50 Recipient\n2013, 2011, & 2010 Diversity Business Top Businesses\nFreightCenter Affiliations\nNASSTRAC Member\nTIA Performance Certified\nSmartWay Certified Partner\nTransportation Intermediaries Assoc.

Why should I use FreightCenter?\nFreightCenter is a 3rd-Party Logistics provider that manages less-than-truckload (LTL) freight shipping, truckload (TL) freight shipping, international shipping, trade show shipments, and specialty shipping. We integrate our proprietary technology solutions with service delivered by your dedicated account managers to provide an unsurpassed level of service at the lowest available price. Our top shippers are our business customers, who rely on us multiple times each month to handle their shipping needs and reduce their supply chain costs. No matter your shipping problem, we will find a cost-effective solution.\nWhat are estimated transit times?\nFreightCenter makes every effort to offer the most cost-effective mode of transportation. Transit times depend on location, destination, service options, mode of transportation, weather, and carrier chosen at the booking time. Transit times are provided by carriers and are estimated, not guaranteed.\nDo you know if I can ship to a trade show?\nYes, our carriers are experts in shipping in time for trade shows, exhibitions, and expos. Shipment can be to a warehouse or the front, depending upon the date and number of transit days. Trade show shipments can be picked up from and delivered to the show site outside regular business hours only when the show dates demand alternative scheduling.\nWhat is LTL shipping?\nFreight shipping is the easiest way to move large and bulky items quickly and efficiently while keeping shipping costs low. LTL (Less-Than-Truckload) shipping handles freight shipments ranging from 100 lbs to 20,000 lbs. When the thing you need shipped or transported is too large to take to the post office or your local parcel company, freight is considered a more economical approach.\nCould you let me know how claims are handled?\nIf your freight arrives damaged, it is essential to accept the shipment to document the claim correctly. A claim must be filed within 48 hours of delivery and can be done directly online on our site. FreightCenter will act as liaison and assist the customer in processing the claim and filing all necessary paperwork. However, we cannot guarantee the shipping company will accept all claims.\nWhat happens if I receive a bill directly from the carrier?\nThis usually occurs when FreightCenter’s BOL is not used at the pick-up time, resulting in a double booking in two systems and a change in shipping rates. Our freight brokers will promptly take care of the paperwork and have the charges properly credited for your freight shipment when notified. Contact our customer service department at 1-800-716-7608. They will instruct you on the best way to send us the bill you’ve received from the carrier.\nShipping Costs: Frequently Asked Questions\nHow do I determine my shipping cost?\nThe quote process is simple and fast at FreightCenter and is available 24/7. You only need the shipment’s origin, destination, weight, dimensions, and contact information to determine your shipping cost. Your free, instant freight quote results will list real-time freight rates from the trusted carriers in our network which meet your shipping requirements. Select your preferred quote and click the CHOOSE button to save your selection. That way, your freight agent can access and review the section before you book your shipment. If you want to get your quote by phone, please call us at 800.716.7608.\nHow to save on shipping costs\nWhat is a freight class, and how does it affect my shipping cost?\nFreight class is an essential factor in determining the total cost charged by the carrier for shipping your item(s). According to the National Motor Freight Transportation Association, Inc., 18 freight classes, ranging numerically from 50 to 500, classify a commodity based on an evaluation of 4 characteristics: density, stowability, handling, and liability. If you need to figure out the freight class of the thing you are shipping, use our Freight Class Lookup Tool, which covers many popularly shipped items. Our instant freight quote tool allows you to get quotes from multiple carriers without knowing the exact freight class of your shipment by calculating the freight class for you based on density. Just plug in the numbers, and the tool does all the work. Once you run a freight quote, your agent will verify that the freight class entered is correct. If you want help determining a freight class, please call us at 800.716.7608.\nDo quotes expire?\nYes. Quotes are based on freight class, dimensions, and weight, but pricing is also subject to fuel price fluctuation. Due to fluctuating fuel costs, a rate or quote is only valid for 24 hours. To lock in the discounted rate, your shipment details need to be 100% accurate, and the shipment needs to be booked within 24 hours of receiving your quoted rate.\nHow do I add another item to my quote?\nClick the +Add Another Item button on the quick quote form to include an item of a different packaging type, weight, dimensions, or freight class. Example: If shipping one pallet and two boxed or crated items, add the pallet shipment details first and click Add Another Item to enter the details for the other packaged items.\nAre there additional fees for residential delivery or pick-up?\nYes. Residential delivery fees apply to shipping freight to a non-commercial location, including apartments, residences, farms, estates, remote areas, and possibly even schools and churches. So that you know, home-based businesses in residential zip codes are billed as residential due to special arrangements that need to be made by the carrier. The cost to ship also can change when delivering to a limited access location (i.e., construction sites, military bases, camps, and storage facilities). Be sure to ask your FreightCenter representative if you are still determining if your location would fall into one of the above categories.\nCan I estimate the weight of my shipment?\nNo. It is critical to the integrity of your quote that you determine the exact weight of the freight items you are shipping. If you book your shipment at an incorrect weight, the freight carrier will discover the error when they weigh the freight (which they can do at any time). If an inaccurate weight is used in booking, a billing adjustment will be made at the carrier’s non-discounted rate and added to your account. Incorrect weight is the cause of more than half of all billing adjustments FreightCenter customers receive. Refrain from guessing. Could you get the weight right?\nAre your rates final and inevitable?\nDue to the high volume, we ship through our network of carriers; we can secure deeply discounted shipping rates. I just wanted to let you know that your shipping quote is based on the information you gave FreightCenter at the booking time. Any changes or differences in the weight, class, size, or location can directly result in additional shipping costs from the carrier. To ensure that your shipping rates stay in line with what was quoted initially, you can use the FreightCenter BOL provided. This lets the page know to bill FreightCenter.com at the pre-negotiated freight rates and discounts.\nBooking: Frequently Asked Questions\nHow far in advance should I schedule a pick-up?\nPlease allow a 4-hour window of time for freight pick-up, and note that most shipping companies make pick-ups in the afternoon and spend their mornings with freight deliveries. Depending on the time of booking in your time zone, we can arrange for same-day pick-up. Always speak directly to a FreightCenter freight agent for special arrangements and urgent bookings.\nWould you like me to be present at pick-up?\nSomeone authorized to sign over the shipment and FreightCenter BOL must be at the pick-up time. If the driver arrives at the pick-up location and either the freight is not ready or there is no one available to sign the BOL, he/she will not usually wait. The pick-up must then be re-dispatched, and some freight companies charge an attempted pick-up fee to cover extra time and miles.\nDo you know if my shipment is automatically insured?\nIt’s essential to understand the difference between freight insurance and carrier liability. The industry-standard liability cargo insurance coverage offered by all LTL carriers booked through FreightCenter is 0.10 cents per pound. That doesn’t cover the value of most shipments, so FreightCenter offers its customers the ability to purchase supplementary freight insurance accessed directly during the freight quote and booking process.\nWho will transport my shipment?\nWe are a freight broker that utilizes the trucks of the largest, most reputable carriers. We ship thousands of loads through our extensive carrier network. If you want a list of the available carriers and shipping costs to move your freight, you can get a quote now. At FreightCenter, we present carrier options. You choose the carrier.\nAre transit times guaranteed?\nFreight shipping transit times begin the day after your freight has been picked up. Freight transit times are not guaranteed unless expressly noted on the freight quote option you select when booking your shipping rates. All other delivery times are estimates that cannot be guaranteed, though they are usually reliable.\nWhat is a Bill of Lading (BOL)?\nA bill of lading is standard, mandatory paperwork providing the carrier and driver with all pertinent information related to the shipping costs and news. This paperwork allows for proper billing to be processed by the shipping company and FreightCenter. All parties involved should have a copy of the BOL (shipper, receiver, and carrier). The FreightCenter BOL must be given to the carrier at pick-up time. Also, could you keep one copy for your records? Not using our paperwork could result in more hassle and extra shipping costs from freight carriers. LEARN MORE ABOUT THE FREIGHTCENTER BOL\nPackaging: Frequently Asked Questions\nHow should I package my freight?\nA securely, properly packed shipment is excellent protection against potentially dangerous road and warehouse conditions. Please ensure that all shipped items are properly and securely packaged to prevent damage. Improper packaging may decrease or nullify the carrier’s liability for damage claims or loss. All freight should be packaged, crated, or stacked and secured onto pallets with banding, stretch-wrap, or breakaway adhesive. Labels should be placed on every freight piece in multiple places.\nFreightCenter offers tips to help you with palletizing, crating, proper skidding and wrapping.\nPackaging and Crating Freight Shipments\nDoes FreightCenter sell or provide packaging material?\nNo. FreightCenter does not sell or provide packaging material, nor does your driver carry items used to package your freight correctly. Before your driver’s arrival, your package should be secured to a pallet and protected from damage.\nWhere can I purchase packaging materials?\nPackaging materials can be found at any home improvement store or parcel shipping store.\nHow do I ship unpackaged furniture?\nThe safest mode of shipment is to use a white glove or blanket wrap service. At an additional cost, this shipping option includes secure packaging by a professional and safe delivery by truck. Ask your FreightCenter agent about white glove or blanket wrap services. MORE ON PACKING FURNITURE\nTracking: Frequently Asked Questions\nHow do I track my shipment?\nEnter your PRO number or Shipment ID number to track the location of your shipment after pick-up has been made. If you need help tracking your shipment on our website, contact customer service using the chat feature in the lower-right-hand corner of the page or call 800.716.7608.\nTRACK SHIPMENT\nWhat is a PRO Number, and how do I get one?\nCarriers use a PRO number to organize and track the progress of each shipment. Your dedicated freight agent should be able to give you the PRO number for your shipment. If you encounter problems tracking your shipment on our website, contact customer service using the chat feature in the lower-right-hand corner of the page or 800.716.7608. read more\nWhat is proof of delivery?\nYour driver will bring a Proof of Delivery Receipt (also known as a Delivery Receipt or DR). This is a document signed at the time of delivery by the consignee; notating freight received in good form, the time of delivery, and the receiver’s name. read more\nHow do I check my shipping status?\nThe best way to check your shipping status may depend on the carrier you selected. In some cases, your FreightCenter agent will notify you before pick-up or delivery. read more\nBilling Frequently Asked Questions\nWhy did I receive a billing adjustment?\nA billing adjustment represents a portion of unpaid freight shipping costs as reported by the carrier. Most billing adjustments result from the incorrect weight being communicated by the shipper. Wrong freight class and the need to add accessorial charges for residential or limited access locations account for a significant percentage of billing adjustments. read more\nHow can I avoid receiving a billing adjustment?\nWhen obtaining a freight quote, the type of commodity, weight, dimensions, pick-up, delivery location, and distance influence the shipping cost. The best way to avoid a change in shipping rates is to ensure that all information given to FreightCenter at the time of booking is 100% complete and accurate. When you schedule your freight shipping, please ensure you are as honest and precise as you can be about your freight’s contents, size, and weight. Do you know where I can view my bill?\nTo view your bill, click the login or MY ACCOUNT button in the top right-hand corner of any screen. You will be prompted to log in with your email address if you aren’t logged in.\nWhat are my payment options?\nFreightCenter accepts all major credit cards for freight shipments booked online or over the phone with a Freight Agent. Arrangements for other payment options, such as domestic, international, or business checks, are accepted case by case. read more\nHave Frequently Asked Questions we haven’t answered here?

We believe shipping shouldn’t be complicated, whether you’re a small business owner or someone sending a package to a friend. We aim to provide you with the best shipping options, competitive rates, and excellent customer service. By doing this, we help businesses grow, and individuals stay connected, positively impacting our customers’ lives.\nCommitted to Excellence\nOur commitment to excellence drives everything we do at FreightCenter. We constantly invest in new technology to improve our services and make shipping more efficient. Our dedicated team works hard to find the best solutions for your shipping needs, ensuring your packages arrive safely and on time. We know that reliable shipping is crucial for your success, and that’s why our mission matters. It’s about helping you achieve your goals with confidence and ease, knowing that your shipping is in good hands.\nOur History\nThe Beginning of FreightCenter\nFreightCenter’s story began with a family-owned shipping and packaging store called “Send It Packing,” run by Matthew and his father, James Brosious. They started this small business with a vision to simplify the complex world of freight shipping for companies and individuals. Working from a modest storefront, they focused on building solid relationships with carriers and customers. Their main goal was to create a one-stop solution where people could easily compare rates and services from different carriers and choose the best option for their shipping needs.\nEmbracing the Internet\nAs the internet became more popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s, FreightCenter saw an opportunity to leverage this new technology to grow their business. They developed an online platform allowing customers to get instant quotes, book shipments, and track deliveries from their computers. This was a significant shift in the freight industry, which had traditionally relied on phone calls and paper documents. By going digital, FreightCenter made shipping faster, easier, and more convenient for everyone.\nTechnological Innovations\nFreightCenter continued to invest in technology to improve its services. They developed advanced software to analyze shipping data and provide customers with the most efficient and cost-effective shipping options. This innovation helped them stand out in the industry and attract more customers. They also introduced tools like real-time tracking and automated notifications, giving customers better control over their shipments and peace of mind.\nExpanding Services\nOver the years, FreightCenter expanded its range of services to meet the diverse needs of its customers. They began offering LTL (less-than-truckload) shipping, full truckload shipping, international shipping, and intermodal shipping, which combines different modes of transportation. FreightCenter could serve a broader range of customers by providing various shipping options, from small businesses to large corporations.\nBuilding a Strong Team\nA critical factor in FreightCenter’s success has been its dedicated team of employees. The company values hard work, innovation, and excellent customer service. They have created a positive work environment where employees are encouraged to share ideas and work together to solve problems. This strong team spirit has helped FreightCenter provide outstanding customer service and maintain a competitive edge in the industry.\nCustomer-Centric Approach\nFreightCenter has always prioritized its customers. It understands that each customer has unique shipping needs and strives to provide personalized solutions. By listening to customer feedback and continuously improving its services, FreightCenter has built a loyal customer base. Its commitment to customer satisfaction is one of the reasons it has remained a trusted name in the freight shipping industry for over two decades.\nLooking to the Future\nToday, FreightCenter is a well-known and respected name in the freight shipping industry. It continues to grow and adapt to its customers’ changing needs. With a focus on technology and customer service, it is always looking for new ways to improve its services and stay ahead of the competition. FreightCenter’s history is a story of innovation, dedication, and a commitment to excellence, and it is determined to continue this legacy in the years to come.\nLearn more about\nCompare LTL Freight Rates\nOur Certifications\nAwards and Endorsements\n2021 Food Logistics’ Top Green Providers\n2021 Supply & Demand Chain Executives’ Pros to Know: Matt Brosious\n2020 Top Food Logistics’ 3PL & Cold Storage Provider Award\n2020 Business Observer’s Top 500 Companies on the Gulf Coast\n2020 SmartWay® Transport Partner\n2020 Food Logistics’ Champions: Rock Stars of the Supply Chain\n2020 Best of Palm Harbor Awards for Local Businesses\n2019 Top Food Logistics’ 3PL & Cold Storage Provider Award\n2019 Business Observer’s Top 500 Companies on the Gulf Coast\n2018 Supply & Demand Chain Executive PRO to Know\n2017 Green Supply Chain Award from Supply & Demand Chain Executive\n2017 Tampa Bay Business Journal Top 200\n2017 Food Logistics’ Champions: Rock Stars of the Supply Chain\n2017 SmartWay® Transport Partner\n2017 Tampa Bay Business Journal Heroes at Work\n2017 &2016 Food Logistics Top Green Providers\n2016, 2015, & 2012 Food Logistics Top 100 Software and Technology Providers\n2013 Jobs Added in 2013 by Tampa Bay Business Journal\n2013 Tampa Bay Business 100 by Tampa Bay Business Journal\n2013 Top 100 Great Supply Chain Partners by SupplyChainBrain\n2012 TIA Samaritan Award Honorable Mention\n2012, 2011 & 2010 TBBJ Fast 50 Recipient\n2013, 2011, & 2010 Diversity Business Top Businesses\nFreightCenter Affiliations\nNASSTRAC Member\nTIA Performance Certified\nSmartWay Certified Partner\nTransportation Intermediaries Assoc.
